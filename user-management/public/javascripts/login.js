/*
	TODO: Implement the checkLogin() function which will call to the
	/users/info endpoint to see if the user is logged in. If the user
	is already logged in, then remove the login form and present a message
	to the user saying that they are already logged in.

	Implement other login functions as well. Use what we have done in class
	as a guide.
